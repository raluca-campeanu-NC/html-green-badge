                    Stray is a 2022 adventure game developed by BlueTwelve Studio and published by Annapurna Interactive. The story follows a stray cat who falls into a walled city populated by robots, machines, and mutant bacteria, and sets out to return to the surface with the help of a drone companion, B-12. The game is presented through a third-person perspective.

                <p>
                    The player traverses the game world by leaping across platforms and climbing up obstacles, and can interact with the environment to open new paths. Using B-12, they can store items found throughout the world and hack into technology to solve puzzles. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game received generally positive reviews, with praise for its artistic design, cat gameplay, narrative, original score, and platforming elements, though critics were divided on the combat and stealth sequences.

                    While a group of four stray cats trek through the ruins of an abandoned facility, one becomes separated from the others after falling into a chasm leading to an unpopulated underground city. The cat finds a lab where it helps download an artificial intelligence into the body of a small drone, which calls itself B-12. It explains it previously helped a scientist but much of its memory was corrupted and needs time to recover.
                </p>
                <p>
                    B-12 promises to help the cat return to the surface and accompanies it further into the city. As they travel farther, the pair discover that, while the city is completely devoid of human life, their robotic servants, Companions, remain.

                <p>
                    With humans absent, the Companions have grown self-aware and have built their own society among the ruins of the city, but they likewise are trapped underground. The ruins are infested with Zurks, mutant bacteria that have evolved to devour both organic life and robots.

They solve puzzles to progress the narrative, often involving moving obstacles.

                    The player is accompanied by a drone companion, B-12, who assists by translating the language of other characters, storing items found throughout the world, providing light, and hacking into various technologies to open paths and solve puzzles.

                    Stray received "generally favorable reviews" according to review aggregator Metacritic, based on 99 reviews for PlayStation 5, 42 reviews for Windows, and eight reviews for Xbox Series X/S. Chris Scullion of Video Games Chronicle considered it one of Annapurna Interactive's best releases, and Andrew Webster of The Verge named it among the best games of the year to date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Critics praised the graphical quality and art design, and several particularly lauded its use of lighting. Alyse Stanley of The Washington Post described Stray as "a master class in environmental story telling and level design", lauding the subtle directions provided to the player.

                    I believe Stray is one of those games you can play anytime, as it's not so intricate that you have to spend hours putting puzzle pieces together, but it still keeps you on your toes. The scenery has a strange charm that invites you to discover the secrets hidden in the agglomeration of buildings, scraps and objects. Although the lack of natural light and vegetation can create a claustrophobic feeling sometimes, you can find some warmth in the little bits of humanity left in the robotic companions.

                <h4>Top 3 things I love about this game</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>You get to be a cat (duh)</li>
                    <li>The graphical quality and art design</li>
                    <li>The gameplay experience was inspired by the founders' and the studio's in-house cats</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    As some of the cats who inspired the behavior of the game's protagonist were strays in the past, I think it's an ideal occasion to point out the importance of adopting animals and offering the less fortunate souls a chance to a safe and warm home.
